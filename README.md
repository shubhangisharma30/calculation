# Calculator
This is a simple calculator GUI built using the tkinter module in Python. 
It has a text field to display the input and output of the calculations, and a set of buttons to enter the digits, operators, parentheses, and to clear the input and evaluate the calculation. 
The GUI has been defined using a grid layout and the functionality of the buttons is implemented using lambda functions.
